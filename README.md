# Y-Link, a Youtube Video Downloader 
A python course project where I and my team mate developed a Django application which downloads youtube videos when a user provides youtube link. It is hosted at pythonanywhere.com.   
Website: http://ylink.pythonanywhere.com.



 This application uses a python web framework called Django which makes use of MVC architecture. Django framework supports back-end of our application by handling all the requests sent by the front-end part of the application possibly via GET/POST methods or REST API. Later a python script written extracts the video located at that particular link provided by the user.
This extracted raw output is available for download. There will be options to choose the format of the video to be downloaded such as MP4, FLV, OGG along with the choice of quality of the audio/video to be downloaded.
